# Gatewiz-EEA-project
Description: Developed a Traffic Light Controller for a highway-farm intersection, priotizing highway traffic. Implemented the project using SystemVerilog OOP principles and Finite State Machines (FSMs) to ensure efficient traffic management with sensor-based vehicle detection.

Technology used: SystemVerilog, FSM, Digital Logic Design, Hardware Simulation.
